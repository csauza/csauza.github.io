She graduated from Deakin University with a Bachelor of Cyber Security with Distinction, and was recognised as a standout woman in security with a diverse background and skillset, when she was chosen as one of three Deakin students in the year 2018, to receive a Westpac Young Technologists Scholarship.
    
    Caitlin's internship with Deloitte in their Cyber Risk Advisory team solidified her motivation to pursue cyber security as a career.

She has passed her CISM exam as of May 2023.
